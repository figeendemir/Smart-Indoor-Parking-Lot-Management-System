# Smart-Indoor-Parking-Lot-Management-System
 The Smart Parking System provides real-time data for efficient and convenient parking by accurately tracking and counting incoming and outgoing vehicles.

The Smart Parking Management System was developed by writing a function in MATLAB
and creating an interface with circuit elements. In a parking area with a Smart Parking System installed, incoming and outgoing traffic can be automatically controlled and synchronized.
MATLAB's vehicle counting mechanism accurately tracks and counts incoming vehicles,
ensuring accuracy in low-light conditions and providing real-time data on parking lot entry. In this way, drivers benefit from a fast and easy parking experience.
